# SKYCOIN WALLET USER MANUAL (WIP)

**CONTENTS:**
	
	1. Sending Coins (Simple Send)

**SECTION 1: SENDING COINS (SIMPLE SEND)**

The Skycoin wallet is designed to facilitate quick and easy transfer of funds between users. The Simple Send transfers Skycoin from your secure wallet to an address of your choice, which could be an exchange, another user, another wallet you control, a merchant, etc. To execute a Simple Send of your funds, do the following:

	1. Open your Skycoin wallet (skycoin.exe). 
	2. Unlock your wallet with your password if you have encrypted it. 
	3. Click "Send" on the taskbar. 
	4. Input your desired Destination address under "Send to". This address will receive the coins you send.	
		(Make sure you double check this address, as any mistaken transaction is irreversible!) 
	5. Under "Amount", input the number of SKY you would like to send. This can also be a decimal number. 
	6. Select "Preview" to ensure you have inputted every value correctly. 
	7. Press "Send" at the bottom of the screen to send your coins and broadcast the transaction onto the blockchain.

	
Simple Sends are not the only way to send coins. You can batch transactions, select which addresses send funds and receive change (the leftover SKY), and change your Coin Hours allocation using Advanced Sends, which are covered in the following section.
